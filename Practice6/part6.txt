The company was founded as EPAM by Belarus natives Arkadiy Dobkin in Princeton, 
New Jersey, and Leo Lozner in Minsk, Belarus in 1993. 
It incorporated as EPAM Systems on December 18, 2002. 
The company has since grown to approximately 30,100 employees, as of March 2019.
EPAM initially stood for "Effective Programming for America", 
though the company simply uses the acronym in all its marketing and information 
materials. On January 24, 2012, 
EPAM announced the launch of an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker EPAM.
This is the first IPO that comes from the outsourcing industry in Eastern Europe.
